To predict house prices, I will use the RandomForestRegressor model trained on cleaned and processed data. The first step is data preprocessing, where I check the data types, remove columns with object data types, and handle any missing values. After that, I will perform data exploration to identify relevant features and split the data into training and validation sets. For modeling, I chose the RandomForestRegressor because of its ability to handle non-linear data and its capability to provide accurate and stable predictions. Using this model, the goal is to achieve optimal house price prediction results.

Dataset from Kaggle: 

"Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users". 

For modeling, a random forest is used.
